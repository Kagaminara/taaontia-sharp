# The amazing adventures of not that interesting adventurers


## Sounds fine, what's this?

A personnal game project, partially based on D&D, and medieval fantasy universe in general.
It will feature procedurally generated quests, turn based dice rolling combat mechanics, and a (bad) crazy storyline.


## What does it use?

At the moment, I plan to use only C++ and [NCurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) ([PDCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/) for Windows).
The libraries used are subject to changes though, since I may find a cooler (AKA simpler) way to do this on the run.


## Why a console game? That's so 1990!

~~Because I'm too lazy to do graphics~~. Mainly because I do love console games. It's like reading a book, you're free to create the universe you want in your mind as you're playing.
Something you can not usually do in "graphic" games.
Don't worry though, I'll try to include some nice ASCII arts every now and then.


## Cool, but what's with this name?

That's the only name I came with. I'm deeply sorry.


## Any ideas for future features?

I don't really like to talk for the future, but I may be interresting in making a web version out of it, once the standalone one is finished.
