# Taaontia: The amazing adventures of not that interesting adventurers


## Sounds fine, what's this?

A personnal game project, partially based on D&D, and medieval fantasy universe in general.
There is currently two parts, a Discord bot client, and the "core" which handles all the logic.
Feature will come on-the-go. For now, the focus is on basically re-discovering C#, .Net and EF.
Features I can see for the forseable future include, but are not limited to:
### "Soon"
- Combats
  - Skills
  - Items
  - Status (commonly called "buffs", "debuffs", "ailments", etc.)
- Characters
  - Stats
  - Experience / Leveling
  - Skillsets
### Future
- Quests
- Multiplayer / Global events

It will probably feature procedurally generated quests, turn based dice rolling combat mechanics, and a (bad) crazy storyline.


## What does it use?

Mainly .NetCore and Entity Framework. There's two main reasons for this project:
- First, because I do love RPGs, and console (read: terminal) games
- Second, I want to train myself on .Net Core and EF


## Why a console game? That's so 1990!

~~Because I'm too lazy to do graphics~~. Mainly because I do love console games. It's like reading a book, you're free to create the universe you want in your mind as you're playing.
Something you can not usually do in "graphic" games.
Don't worry though, I'll try to include some nice ASCII arts every now and then.


## Cool, but what's with this name?

That's the only name I came with. I'm deeply sorry.


## Any ideas for future features?

Since I'm only focusing on the Core / Discord bot for now, future update should include a console client, and a nicely made documentation for anyone to implement their own beautiful client.
